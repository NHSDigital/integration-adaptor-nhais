### Known Issues
- NIAD-340: If an invalid message is published to the `nhais_mesh_inbound` queue when the application is run **using the 
  docker-compose file provided** the application will log errors indefinitely. Purging this queue using the Active MQ 
  web console will stop the errors. __Other deployments should use a broker configured as per the README.md to avoid 
  this issue.__
- NIAD-385: The adaptor may on occasion log an exception (related to toString) but continue to operate as expected
- NIAD-383: The control characters (' + : ?) that must be escaped in EDIFACT are not handled correctly. Outbound 
  transactions using  these characters will produce invalid EDIFACT and inbound transactions using these characters will
  not be parsed correctly.
