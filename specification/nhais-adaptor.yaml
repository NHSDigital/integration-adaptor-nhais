  title: GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor API

    You can:
    * Accept a new patient
    * Amend an existing patient's demographics
    * Request a Removal for a patient who has moved out of area
    * Request a Deduction for a supported reason

    The GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor does not store any patient demograpic data and no GET operations are supported.

    The API is based on the [Personal Demographics Service API](https://github.com/NHSDigital/personal-demographics-service-api)

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You donâ€™t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example the `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    - data items related to an operation rather than the resource are represented as `Parameter`s

    ## Example Requests

    A number of example requests are available as part of the adaptor's user acceptance tests.

    The [Examples](https://github.com/nhsconnect/integration-adaptor-nhais/blob/develop/README.md#examples) section
    of the README explains these examples in further detail.

        ## WORK IN PROGRESS

        This endpoint is not implemented yet and the specification is expected to change.

        ## Overview

        Use this endpoint to send a Deduction transaction to NHAIS.

        ## Operation Id

        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS

        ## Payload Description

        The request payload is a Parameters list. The list must contain parameters with the following names and values:

        * `patient`: Patient `resource` containing id, generalPractitioner, and managingOrganization
        * `deductionReason`: simple parameter with `valueString` one of: death, emigrated, other
        * `deductionDate`: simple parameter with `valueDate` the date (no time) of the deduction in ISO format
        * `freeText`: simple parameter with `valueString` a brief, free-text reason for the deduction

        ## Operation Id
        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS

        ## WORK IN PROGRESS

        This endpoint is not implemented yet and the specification is expected to change.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an Amendment to NHAIS.

        This is a 'patch' operation, meaning you can update specific parts of the patient record (such as a name or an address), as opposed to having to update the entire record.

        ## Operation Id
        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS

        ## Payload Description

        An Amendment to any of the following data items for a patient on the GP System MUST be captured for transmission to the HA responsible for that patient:

        [Deprecated] = fields described in the original NHAIS specification that have since been deprecated and are not supported by the adaptor

        * Surname
        * First Forename
        * Second Forename
        * Other Forenames
        * Previous Surname
        * Title
        * Sex
        * Date of Birth
        * Address - 5 fields
        * Postcode
        * Drugs Dispensed Marker
        * [Deprecated] RPP Mileage
        * [Deprecated] Blocked Route/Special District Marker
        * [Deprecated] Walking Units
        * Residential Institute Code

        Amendments to any other items of patient information will not be advised to an HA.

        TODO: There are some GP Links messaging requirements that go against the spirit of a patch. For example, if any name
        is changed then all name items must be provided. Similarly, if any address item is changed then all address items
        must be provided. There is an open query to determine if there is a possibility to either relax these requirements
        or not use JSONPatch at all in favour or a PUT or a POST operation with a Patient parameter.
