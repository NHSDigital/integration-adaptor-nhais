  title: GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor (FHIR) API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to access the GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor API

    You can:
    * Accept a new patient
    * Amend an existing patient's demographics
    * Request a Removal for a patient who has moved out of area
    * Request a Deduction for a supported reason

    The GP Links - NHAIS Adaptor does not store any patient demograpic data and no GET operations are supported.

    The API is based on the [Personal Demographics Service API](https://github.com/NHSDigital/personal-demographics-service-api)

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/developer-reference/introduction-to-apis#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You donâ€™t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example the `/Patient` not `/patients`
    - array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    - data items related to an operation rather than the resource are represented as `Parameter`s

    ## Example Requests

    A number of example requests are available as part of the adaptor's user acceptance tests.

    The [Examples](https://github.com/nhsconnect/integration-adaptor-nhais/blob/develop/README.md#examples) section
    of the README explains these examples in further detail.

        ## Status

        **Version 0.1.0**: Only data items marked REQUIRED are supported for translation to EDIFACT. Optional data items
        are accepted by the API but not translated into EDIFACT.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an Acceptance to NHAIS.

        ## Supported Acceptance Types

        * Type 1 - Birth
        * Type 2 - First Acceptance
        * Type 3 - Transfer In
        * Type 4 - Immigrant

        Type 5 - Ex-Services is no longer used. Such patients are now registered as Type 3 - Transfer In.

        ## Supported Fields

        Refer to GP Links Specification Chapter 3 for the complete requirements for manually-entered acceptances. The
        values sent to the adaptor must comply with the GP Links Specification and FHSREG:0:1:FH:FHS001.

        https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais/guide-to-nhais-gp-links-documentation

        Three fields are DEPRECATED and not supported by the adaptor:

        * RPP Mileage
        * Blocked Route/Special District Marker
        * Walking Units

        REQUIRED - If any of these data items are not provided or are blank then the adaptor will produce a 400 error
        OPTIONAL - These data items may be included if available
        DEPRECATED - The adaptor provides no FHIR representation for these items and it is not possible to include them
        NOT REQUIRED - These data items are will be ignored if provided

        Any other values not listed in the tables below and provided in the request that are valid for a FHIR R4
        Parameter or Patient resource will be ignored.

        When you submit an amendment an operation id will be included in the response. This operation id MUST be retained
        to match against the asynchronous reply from NHAIS

        ## Status

        This endpoint is not implemented yet. The design is complete but some changes to specification may still be required.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an Amendment to NHAIS.

        This is a 'patch' operation, meaning you can update specific parts of the patient record (such as a name or an address),
        as opposed to having to update the entire record.

        The adaptor is not a FHIR server and cannot perform actual patches onto Patient resources. Instead the patches are
        translated into an equivalent EDIFACT message. This places some restrictions on the patches accepted by the adaptor:

        * The value of "path" must match exactly those listed in the "FHIR / JSONPatch Field Mappings" table below. Logically
          equivalent alternatives are not permitted.
        * The only supported operations are add, replace, and remove
        * The add and replace operations are synonymous for GP Links
        * The GP System must only use remove operations for data items for which GP Links permits removal
        * With the exceptions of Drugs Dispensed Marker and Residential Institute Code, the GP System must use remove
          operations to erase an existing value. Performing an add or replace with an empty or null value will not work.
        * Each path most only be used once within the amendment request. It is not possible to, for example, perform a
          remove and an add on the same path within the same request.

        ## Supported Fields

        Refer to GP Links Specification Chapter 3.5 for the complete requirements for manually-entered amendments. The
        values sent to the adaptor must comply with the GP Links Specification and FHSREG:0:1:FH:FHS001.

        https://digital.nhs.uk/services/nhais/guide-to-nhais-gp-links-documentation

        Three fields are deprecated and not supported by the adaptor:

        * RPP Mileage
        * Blocked Route/Special District Marker
        * Walking Units
