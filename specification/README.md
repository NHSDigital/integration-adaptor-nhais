# GP Links - NHAIS OpenAPI Documentation

For convenience an [HTML Version](out/index.html) of [nhais-adaptor.yaml](nhais-adaptor.yaml) is committed into the 
repository. The HTML should not be considered official documentation. Any examples, code samples, and references to SDKs
in this HTML document are incorrect.

This is a temporary solution to facilitate review and feedback while the adaptor is in development. If you need to
regenerate this HTML document you may do so with the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) too.
