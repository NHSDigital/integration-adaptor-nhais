            Symbol, in syntax, defined by the system:
            * Code 1 - Informal death notice received via an update from a local NHS Organisation such as GP practice or Trust
            * Code 2 - Formal death notice received from Registrar of Deaths. Only these endpoints are allowed to add a Formal death:
                - National Back Office using the Demographic Spine Application (DSA)
                - Office of National Statistics (ONS)
                - Maternity sites
            * Code U - Removed. This is a possible response, but it cannot be used on an update because Spine will reject it
